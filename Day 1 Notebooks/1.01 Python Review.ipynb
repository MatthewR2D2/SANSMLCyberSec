    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Python and R are the primary languages used for data science and machine learning.  Since we are coming at this problem from an information security perspective and Python is so prevalent in this space, we will use Python throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students were informed that they should come to class with at least a basic background in Python.  This section will review the fundamentals of lists, tuples, and arrays in addition to introducing some of the fundamentals of NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Get all of the required libraries configured\n",
    " * Explain the differences between lists, tuples, arrays, and dictionaries\n",
    " * Create all of these various objects\n",
    " * Iterate and enumerate these objects\n",
    " * Perform basic list comprehensions\n",
    " * Create NumPy arrays\n",
    " * Perform some basic manipulations of NumPy arrays\n",
    " \n",
    "## Estimated Time: 30 - 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will rely heavily on Python, Numpy, Pandas, and a number of other libraries for our exercises.  For this reason, we want to take some time to have you walk through some material that is both refresher (the Python part, hopefully) and a gentle introduction to some fundamentals (for Numpy and Pandas)."

    "Before we dive into the Python Review lab, we want to make certain everything needed for all of the rest of the labs in the course is set up.  Additionally, your instructor will walkthrough using Anaconda to create a new environment, as outlined below.  If you are taking the class through OnDemand, you should walk through these steps along with the studio recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "*PLEASE NOTE!* - If you are using a Macintosh, you must additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a browser to go to https://brew.sh (Homebrew is a package management tool for MacOS)\n",
    "2. Copy the command line on that home page and paste it into a terminal window to have it automatically download and install the manager.\n",
    "3. After the installation completes, in a terminal window execute `brew install cmake` to get the cmake package installed.  Itâ€™s not on a Mac by default.\n",
    "4. Next, execute `brew install openssl` to install the Open SSL development libraries and headers.\n",

    "## Creating an Anaconda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda GUI is a wonderfully easy way to start tools like Jupyter Lab.  Unfortunately, if you start Jupyter through this interface, you will not be able to monitor Jupyter's status or see any warnings or errors that would be displayed at the console.  For this reason, we strongly recommend running Jupyter from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you could use the `base` environment that comes with Anaconda, which already has Jupyter installed, but this isn't a great idea either.  Why not?  When working with Python, it isn't unusual to need to switch to different versions of Python, or to use different versions of various libraries to deal with different code dependencies.  If you get into the habit of installing everything into the `base` environment, or worse, into your system Python if you are on a Mac or on Linux, it can be very difficult to detangle all of the different versions.  This is where Python virtual environments come in.\n",

    "![Anaconda Prompt](../images/anaconda-prompt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have opened a prompt, you can now create a new Python environment to work with.  We would recommend using Python 3.10.  You also need to select a name for the environment you will use.  Any name is fine.  It might be good to choose a name related to the class so that you know what it is when you see it again some months from now.\n",

    "It is *very likely* that you will be prompted about updating Anaconda.  You may do this if you wish, but it is absolutely not necessary for anything related to the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of information will stream by, ending with a prompt asking you whether Anaconda should proceed.  You should hit 'y' and press enter:\n",
    "\n",

Before we dive into NumPy arrays, let's first take some time to experiment with Python tuples, lists, arrays, and dictionaries.  We'll end up using all of these at some point during this course.

We may not use this extensively in our course, but we will find a few places, especially when we start exploring the creation of TensorFlow datasets using generators, where they are used.  A tuple is an *immutable ordered set of objects*.  Notice that we do not define a tuple as an ordered set of *values*.  This is because, as you are likely aware, everything in Python is an object.\n",

    "### Iterating\n",
    "Now that we have a tuple to work with, let's explore it just a bit.  As it turns out, Python tuples, lists, and arrays all have a number of common methods that they implement.  A key example is that we can *iterate*, or process each element successively, over each of these types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different ways to iterate over an iterable class.  One of the most familiar is the `for` loop.  We can use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

For example, is it possible that when we created our tuple with what appear to be mixed object types, Python just cast them all to be strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate, we can make use of the `type()` function.  This built-in function will return the type or class of the object that you pass to it.\n",

    "### F-String Aside\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that you could have solved the printing aspect of the last task.  For example, a very straightforward way to approach it would be to use the following statement inside of a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(type(item), item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative that was introduced with Python 3 are *f-strings*, or formatted strings.  Python has long supported formatted output of strings using a variety of formatting options, but Python 3 introduced a much simpler way to approach formatted output.  Using an f-string we can embed the variables directly into our format string without having to work out locations and pass a long list of variables at the end!  Using them is quite simple.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f'Item class: {type(item)}\\tValue: {item}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our quoted string is prefixed with a lowercase *f*.  Within this string we can embed any variable, function, or expression that we wish by enclosing it within curly-braces ({}).  That value will be inserted into the output directly with no additional processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also notice that we have used single quotes for our f-string.  This is not a requirement.  You can use either single or double quotes.  Which you choose to use is completely up to you and is ultimately a style choice.  It is good to be consistent, though you might choose to leverage them to avoid escaping characters.  Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f\"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.\")\n",
    "print(f'Hal said, \"All my circuits are functioning properly.\"')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these strings are completely valid.  Can you see the difference?  In the first case we used double quotes and in the second we used single quotes.  To what end?  To avoid having to escape the embedded quotes!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a number of languages (Perl, Ruby, Bash, etc.) there is a very big distinction between single and double quoted strings.  Usually a single quoted string is a string literal and a double quoted string supports string interpolation.  *This is not true in Python.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enumeration while Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will want to iterate over a tuple, list, array, or other iterable and we will want to keep track of the *index* of the current object.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "idx = 0\n",
    "for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "    print(f'Item index: {idx}\\tItem value: {item}')\n",
    "    idx = idx + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this code works perfectly well, it is not *pythonic*.  Whether or not something is pythonic is determined by whether or not we have used the features of the language to express our intent in a way that is beautiful, explicit, simple, uncomplicated, as flat as possible, as sparse as possible, and as readable as possible.  To be frank, some of these are debatable.  What might be perfectly readable for one person might be completely unintelligible for another with less Python experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, there is a built-in function, `enumerate()`, that can be used to achieve the same result more simply and more beautifully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
